Mood Drone is an open source, happy little web app mimicking a radio widget. It is based on Docubyte's phenomenal [Guide to Computing](https://www.docubyte.com/works/guide-to-computing/)

It supports user defined alarms and it's mostly intended to play moody songs that would lull the user to a healthy night's sleep.
